bar | looks best by far, replace logic or with ∧ ∨  ascii V as or?
?
# to fix v
# to fix v
# what wrong with v is logical or, but I think we can work around that
|| as prefix kinda
then you will always need () when using |adas|adasd but thats fine?
# yeah should be fine
5.times(||puts rand)# isn't rust like this?
(0..5).map(|_|puts rand)# isn't rust like this?
#hat actually works and its "beautiful"
# yayayayayayay
# lol
#idk how to diff tuple vs "math parens"
# doesn't have to be different, now tuple is a thing? sure
# it can be simliar to the delimiited list yes, either tuple -> body or ident -> body
# parse a tuple thing then check maybe_function
#lets think about this
#what if you want 5.times{puts rand}
#5.times(()->puts(rand))?
#5.times{puts rand} do we keep trailing {} blocks, and transpile them to normal lambda 
#t.times{puts rand} -> 5.times(lambda{puts rand}) ?
# idk
#{} blocks is kinda nice ...

# its no longer changes in syntax, but that shouldnt really matter, but its a big ... thing to implement

# I will try to tokenize almost all possible ruby code, not as ruby does it, but as it should be done :)
